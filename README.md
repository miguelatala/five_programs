# five_programs

In this repository you'll find 5 simple programs in bash. 
1. A questionnaire that will get some information and at the end it will tell what did he learn from you.
2. Countdown timer. You can enter any positive number and it will fade from it to zero second by second.
3. Bingo will throw a random number with its respective letter in a range of 1 to 75.
4. Fortune will ask you for a yes/no question and it'll give you an mysterious answer.
5. This last one will run all the programs consecutively.
